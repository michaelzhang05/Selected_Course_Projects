There are 3 .py file in this zip file, namely "mySA.py", "SA.py", and "TSP.py", the use of these files are as below:
    SA.py: the realization of simulated annealing, which is used in Problem 2 Part a,
           the parameters are total steps is 100,000 and initial temprerature is 100.
    mySA.py: the realization of simultated annealing with proposed cooling schedule,
             which is used in Problem 2 Part c, the parameters are total steps is 1,000,000 and initial temperature is 10.
    TSP.py: external resource to be imported by the above files.

All the code should be able to run directly with command "python file_name.py" in the terminal.

However, just in case and to be clear, the python version I use is Python 3.9.13 and the pip version is pip 22.1.2.
If there is any issues running the code, please contact me and I will see what's wrong.
